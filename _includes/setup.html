<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything
  (or at least to download the installers)
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      Make sure you install, or have available, a text editor that
      you are comfortable with using.
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      We teach with Python version 2.7,
      since it is still the most widely used.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
    </p>

    <h4>Secured Shell </h4>
    <p>
      ssh, scp, rsync  
    </p>

    <h4>OSG </h4>
    <p>
    If you do not have an account on the open science grid, please 
    <a href="http://osgconnect.net/signup">Sign Up</a>. It takes about 4-10 minutes 
 to complete the sign up process and about 30 minutes to get your account 
 activated.  
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software Carpentry Installer,
      it is a basic editor integrated into the lesson material.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
      popular free code editor for Windows.
      Be aware that you must add its installation directory to your system path
      in order to launch it from the command line
      (or have other tools like Git launch it for you).
      Please ask your instructor to help you do this.
    </p>
    <h4>Git Bash</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Windows by download and running
      <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
      This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
    </p>
    <h4>Software Carpentry Installer</h4>
    <p>This installer requires an active internet connection</p>
    <p>After installing Python and Git Bash:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the <a href="http://files.software-carpentry.org/SWCarpentryInstaller.exe">installer</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the file opens directly in the browser select <strong>File&rarr;Save Page As</strong>
        to download it to your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Double click on the file to run it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download and install  <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use all of the defaults for installation
        <em>except</em>
        make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend
      <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,
      so no need to install anything.  You access bash from
      the Terminal (found
      in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want
      to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Mac by downloading and running
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">the installer</a>.  For older
      versions of OS X (10.5-10.7) use the most recent available
      installer <a href="https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list">available
      here</a>. Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow Leopard
      installer for 10.6-10.7.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>

        Download and install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use all of the defaults for installation
        <em>except</em>
        make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.

    </ul>

    <h4>Secured Shell </h4>
    <p>
      ssh, scp, rsync  
    </p>

    <h4>OSG </h4>
    <p>
    If you do not have an account on the open science grid, please

<h3>Linux</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for Linux users.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>,
      but if your machine is set up differently
      you can run it by opening a terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.
      There is no need to install anything.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
      to install it via your distro's package manager
      (e.g. <code>apt-get</code> or <code>yum</code>).

  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
      <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
      (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
      comfortable doing the installation yourself just
      download the installer and we'll help you at the workshop.)
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the installer that matches your operating
        system and save it in your home folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open a terminal window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
        tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
        appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press enter. You will follow the text-only
        prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the
        screen press the down arrow to move down through the
        text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
        the license. Press enter to approve the default
        location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to
        your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>
  As an alternative to the above, you can  use a virtual machine (VM)
  rather than install all the software above. To use a VM:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Download our <a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B4Kr6DYkzkQtd05FekRId05DLXM&amp;export=download">VM image</a>.
    <strong>Warning:</strong>
    this file is 1.7 GByte,
    so please download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
  </li>
  <li>
    Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance"
    and loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
  </li>
</ol>
